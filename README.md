# Sephora Skincare Product Analysis

This project focuses on analyzing skincare products from Sephora, covering data scraping, cleaning, and rating prediction.

## File Descriptions

- `ScrapeSephora.ipynb`: Jupyter Notebook for scraping skincare product data from the Sephora website. It retrieves URLs, stores webpages, extracts product details, and exports data to CSV.
  
- `CleanSephoraProducts.ipynb`: Jupyter Notebook for cleaning and preparing the scraped product information. It renames columns, applies string transformations, extracts product size, filters skincare products, generates dummy variables, and creates product connections.

- `ProductAnalsys.ipynb`: Jupyter Notebook for analyzing and predicting average ratings for skincare products. It includes data exploration, preprocessing, building a linear regression model, and evaluating the model's performance.
